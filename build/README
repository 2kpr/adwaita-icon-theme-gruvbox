Bugs and Requests
-----------------

Requests for icons that will be useful for more than a a single application and
it makes sense to share it in an icon theme should be filed in GNOME bugzilla
(bugzilla.gnome.org) under the gnome-icon-theme module.


High resolution icons
=====================

Application launcher icons and filetype icons in general will benefit in
providing a high resolution variant. For Tango, the canvas size is 256x256 pixels.

We suggest creating artwork for this large canvas as vectors. It may require
more time as vector art with filter effects tends to be very computentionally
intensive, but the benefit is that it allows to create derivative works easily.
In addition, if we need a higher resolution than 256x256 in future, it's simply
a matter of re-rendering the icons.

Due to the large canvas a lot of the guidelines discussed elsewhere in this document do not apply. What still stands is the use of colors, the perspective and lighting.

Inkscape workflow tips:
-----------------------

* The 256x256 icon needs to be nice when scaled down to 64x64 (25% zoom), so, in inkscape, it's necessary to use a 1x1 pixels grid with major lines every 4. Lining up the main objects to the major lines of the grid will help making the icon less blurry when scaled down.

* Text: the best trick we found (atm) for text in high resolution icons is to use the text tool to write something (lorem ipsum, funny things, nonsenses and so on:-)) using the Bitstream Vera Sans typeface with a 6pt size, trying to have the main bodies of the letters between two horizontal major grid lines, then we convert the text object to path and simplify (ctrl+l) 3 times. In case the text is not visible enough when scaling down overlaying the line with a very subtle rectangle 4px tall will help (see text-x-generic).
