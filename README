GNOME Symbolic Icons
====================

Purpose of this icon theme is to extend the base icon theme that follows the Tango style guidelines for specific purposes. This would include OSD messages, panel system/notification area, and possibly menu icons. 

Icons follow the naming specification, but have a -symbolic suffix, so only applications specifically looking up these symbolic icons will render them. If a -symbolic icon is missing, the app will fall back to the regular name.

Primitive build instructions
============================

Running the r.rb script will chop up the "source" SVG into individual icons. 

Targets
=======

Here's places that should make use of this style (and look up icons as -symbolic).

	* Panel systray (and gnome-shell equivalents)
	* Nautilus' sidebar eject emblem for mounted drives
	* OSD (volume levels, display, eject etc)
	* text input widgets (caps lock warning, clear icons)
	
HOWTO
=====

The whole set is maintained in a single SVG, src/gnome-stencils.svg. Each context (apps, actions, mimetypes...) lives inside an Inkscape layer (group). Any group inside that layer is treated as an icon and will be exported into the gnome/scalable/<context>/<inkscape:label>-symbolic.svg of the group. This export is handled by using Inkscape's verbs, which means it will pop up Inkscape GUI at you and will take ages.
