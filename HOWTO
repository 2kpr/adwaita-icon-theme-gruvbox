- each context nees a separate layer
- every group in th elayer will be exported
- so any group inside the layer should be 16x16
- best practice is to have a group include a 16x16 rectangle with no fill and no stroke to make sure the group is 16x16px
- to select that, go into outline mode
- group label will be used for final svg filename (+ -symbolic suffix)
- best way to work with groups is to enter them with ctrl+enter and then exit with ctrl+backspace
